            Did you know that units of measurement are just social conventions?
            Accordingly to Wikipedia <em>website</em>:

            <p>
              <em
                >"A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity,
                defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a
                standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity. Any other
                quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit
                of measurement. For example, a length is a physical quantity.
                The metre (symbol m) is a unit of length that represents a
                definite predetermined length. For instance, when referencing
                '10 metres' (or 10 m), what is actually meant is 10 times the
                definite predetermined length called 'metre'."</em

                measurement have played a crucial role in human endeavour from
                early ages up to the present. A multitude of systems of units
                used to be very common. Now there is a global standard, the
                International System of Units (SI), the modern form of the
                metric system. In trade, weights and measures is often a subject
                of governmental regulation, to ensure fairness and transparency.
                The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is
                tasked with ensuring worldwide uniformity of measurements and
                their traceability to the International System of Units
                (SI)."</em

              <em
                >"Metrology is the science of developing nationally and
                internationally accepted units of measurement.In physics and
                metrology, units are standards for measurement of physical
                quantities that need clear definitions to be useful.
                Reproducibility of experimental results is central to the
                scientific method. A standard system of units facilitates this.
                Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of
                weights and measures historically developed for commercial
                purposes. Science, medicine, and engineering often use larger
                and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday
                life. The judicious selection of the units of measurement can
                aid researchers in problem solving (see, for example,
                dimensional analysis).In the social sciences, there are no
                standard units of measurement and the theory and practice of
                measurement is studied in psychometrics and the theory of
                conjoint measurement."</em
